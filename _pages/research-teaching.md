### Teaching
Precision Care Medicine is a two-semester project-based learning course. Projects will use methods of machine learning and mechanistic and statistical modeling to develop novel data-driven solutions to important health care problems that arise in anesthesiology and critical care medicine. The scope of such problems is vast, and few have been approached before.
